# Weather-Lookup-App (Started: 2023-01-05)

This weather lookup project is built using JavaScript, HTML + CSS and JS libraries (jQuery, React). The web page is designed to display a series of information using the OpenWeatherMap API and Google Maps API: 

- City name
- Current temperature
- Weather description
- Icon
- Wind speed
- Humidity
- Sunrise/Sunset time ****(Update 2023-01-16: Reconstructed code, now the sunrise section displays sunrise/sunset time based on that city's local time; fixed the bug where it converts other cities' time to PST.)****
- Current date

The webpage has separate sections, in which the first section asks for location permission and automatically displays the above information. User is also able to perform searching using the search bar at the top right hand corner, which autocompletes user input for city names using Google Maps Places API.

Features to add:

- UV Index
- Feels-like temperature
- Side menu to store cities currently present on the page
- (...)
